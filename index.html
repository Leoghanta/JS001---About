        <h1>About Developing Software</h1>
        <p>This is an introductory programming module that will enable you to develop the basic
            knowledge of software development skills.  We will be looking at JavaScript which is 
            an introductory language to software development, but also pertinent to the web development
            modules you will be working on. 
        </p> 

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>H17334</h2>
            <p>This is your SQA unit code. This module will credit you with 1 HN credit at SCQF Level 7. 
               This is a <span class="highlight">core module</span> which means you need this module to 
               pass your HNC Digital Design and progress to the HND. 
            </p>
            <p>This module has two learning outcomes:</p>
            <h3>Outcome 1</h3>
            <p>Implement and test code to carry out tasks following a given design.</p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Make appropriate use of variables</li>
                <li>Use programming constructs (Selection and Iteration) within code</li>
                <li>Use functions and parameter passing</li>
                <li>Test the code using a recognised test strategy and given test cases</li>
                <li>Document the result of testing</li>
            </ol></p>
            <h3>Outcome 2</h3>
            <p>Prepare technical documentation in line with good practice</p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Apply meaningful names to variables and functions</li>
                <li>Ensure that code is well laid out to aid maintainability</li>
                <li>Internally document the code by adding comments</li>
                <li>Produce technical guide</li>
            </ol></p>
            <p>More details can be found from the <a href="https://www.sqa.org.uk/files/hn/H17334.pdf">SQA</a></p>

            <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                <li>✅ It is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>
                <li>✅ Javascript is the programming language of the Web.</li>
                <li>✅ JavaScript is easy to learn.</li>
                <li>✅ You can use this module in conjunction with your other modules to build interactive web sites.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript can also springboard you into further learning for Node.js, React.js, AJAX, Vue, Angular, Nuxt, Ember, etc.
                The JavaScript we will be learning in class will be client-side. HND will cover more programming for server-side
                programming. When you are confident with front-end development (client-side) and back-end development (server-side) we 
                call this full stack development. 
            </p>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Assessments</h2>
            <p>
                This module has two outcomes which will be assessment into one assessment. The assessment will contain a web-based 
                problem where you will need to follow a design and build the JavaScript code to make it work. The code 
                will then go through a thorough testing phase and you will produce technical documentation to acompany your 
                finished product.  
            </p>

            <h2>What will this semester look like?</h2>
            <p>
                The roadmap of your semester is below.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>In weeks 1 to 3, we will look at the JavaScript code and you will be able to build 
               code snippets and getting to know the structure of the language.
            </p>
            <p>In weeks 4 to 6, we will look at structuring our code, looking at code flow, and organising 
               the code into programs. By week 6, you will be a JavaScript programmer. 
            </p>
            <p>In weeks 7 to 9, we will bring our programming style to the Document Object Model to 
               create interactive web pages. 
            </p>
            <p>In weeks 10 to 12, we will look at the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with a view 
               of building software and fully testing it for deployment.
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the last four weeks will be reserved for the assessment.</p>
